Homework #4

For this project, I made a timed quiz. When the start button is clicked, the one-minute timer begins and simultaneously the first question appears. When that question is answered, the second question replaces it, and so forth for a total of four questions. As questions are answered, a score div is keeping track of points in the background. When the timer is up, the quiz is over and a prompt fires saying "Time's Up!", then a second prompt fires asking the user for their initials. If the user answers all the questions before the timer is up, a prompt fires asking for initials. At the end of the quiz a score box also appears showing the score, 3 points for every correct answer.

Problems: 

I can get the timer to stop when all questions are answered, but not reset to zero (which would trigger function "theEnd" to fire prompts

I don't know how to save the initials or score to the local storage, despite all my efforts

The questions are still my placeholder questions, sorry
